#HTTTML

## What is this?

HTTTML is a fun alternative to vanilla HTML. With HTTTML you can add a little extra flavor to your code while remaining completely semantic. Change your boring, standard markup, to include custom tags with more interesting and unique names. Works best with object-oriented CSS boilerplates such as [Basscss](http://basscss.com), which, along with HTTTML, was used to build this site.

### Why was it created?

This was created for fun. It is not recommended that you use HTTTML in production for a major application, despite how well it may perform.

## Getting Started

To begin, simply download the source files [here](http://bit.ly/1HL9VMJ) or by cloning this repo.

Finally, include jQuery and the path to the htttml.js file, ideally right before your closing body tag.

```<script type="text/javascript" src="your/path/jQuery.min.js"></script>```
<br/>
```<script type="text/javascript" src="your/path/htttml.1.0.js"></script>```

Once HTTTML is included on your page, define your custom tags in the js file and start writing some code. It's that simple!
