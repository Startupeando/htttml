#HTTTML

## What is this?

HTTTML is a fun alternative to vanilla HTML. With HTTTML you can add a little extra flavor to your code while remaining completely semantic. Change your boring, standard markup, to include custom tags with more interesting and unique names. Works best with object-oriented CSS boilerplates such as [Basscss](http://basscss.com), which, along with HTTTML, was used to build this site.

### Why was it created?

This was created for fun. It is not recommended that you use HTTTML in production for a major application, despite how well it may perform.

## Getting Started

To begin, simply download the source files [here](http://#.com) or by cloning this repo.

Finally, include the path to the htttml.js file, ideally right before your closing body tag.

Once you have HTTTML included on your page, your custom HTML tags will be converted back to their default tags. The js is not required, but it is encouraged that you include it if you need your HTML to be completely semantic.# htttml
